title: Change enterprise edition usage
type: change
description: |
  Usage of the enterprise edition of the platform is evolving: it is no longer a matter of a single 
  `com.axelor:axelor-enterprise-edition` module to depended on, but of different variant of the core modules.
  
  As of now, to use enterprise edition, remove the dependency `com.axelor:axelor-enterprise-edition` 
  and add the property `axelor.platform.ee = true` in your `gradle.properties`. This will automatically 
  update your dependencies to use requires and right EE modules.
