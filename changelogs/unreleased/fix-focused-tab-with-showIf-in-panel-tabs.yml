title: Fix focused tab with showIf in panel-tabs
type: fix
description: |
  On a form view, when first tab of panel-tabs contains showIf/hideIf expression,
  so initially it will be hidden and staring focus will be on tab which doesn't contain
  showIf/hideIf expression.
  In this case, it should re-focus active tab to starting tab if starting tab is accessible.
