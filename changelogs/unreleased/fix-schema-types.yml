title: Fix view schema deserialisation issues
type: feature
description: |
  The view schema types are designed with JSON serialisation in mind. However,
  with the new studio designer, we also need proper JSON deserialisation support.
  
  - added missing annotations
  - added missing getter/setters
  - added missing subtype annotations
  - added `x-json-model` on to AbstractView to identify view by custom model
  - added `id` attribute to form/grid view items
  - fix widgetAttrs deserialization issue
  - use `PanelField` instead of base `Field`
  - fix duplicate `type` key in serialized view json
  - fix view width serialization issue
